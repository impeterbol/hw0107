// 1) user opens the page with a start button;
// a. On the page there is a link to another html file - Vie scores
// b. On the page there is a let timeCount = 75;
// 2) User click startButton, question and 1  answer is presented
// a. timeCount starts adding 1 sec every sec
// 3) When user answers a question incorrectly - a sign appears "Not correct"
// a. timeCount adds substracts 15 sec once and then continues substracting 1 sec as usual
// 4) If user answers correctly - user proceeds to the next question (for test there is no next q - just a sign - "thank yoU!"); user score is stored to the local storage
// 5) if timeCount = 0 (for example) OR sign Thank You appeared (=quiz ended), users' score is presented from local storage and two input fields ask user to input their name and email; this is stored in the local storage;




// ## Instructions


//   * The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

//   * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

//   * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

//   * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.

// * Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

// * Refer to the animated GIF below for a demonstration of the application functionality.

// ### Hints

// * Store your questions as an array of objects in a separate file, `questions.js`, that follows this format:

// ```js
// var questions = [
//   {
//     title: "Commonly used data types DO NOT include:",
//     choices: ["strings", "booleans", "alerts", "numbers"],
//     answer: "alerts"
//   },
//   {
//     title: "The condition in an if / else statement is enclosed within ____.",
//     choices: ["quotes", "curly brackets", "parentheses", "square brackets"],
//     answer: "parentheses"
//   },
//   ///etc.
// ];
// ```

// * The length of the array in `questions.js` determines the length of play. Fifteen seconds per question is a good estimate, so 5 questions will result in a length of play of 75 seconds.


// ## Minimum Requirements

// * Functional, deployed application.

// * GitHub repository with README describing project.

// * The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.

// * Clicking the start button displays a series of questions.

// * Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.

// * If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.

// * The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.

// * After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.

// ## Bonus

// * Add audio files to alert the user of correct or incorrect answers. Be sure to include the appropriate license.

// * Customize the application theme.

// * Create multiple quizzes and an option for users to choose between them.

// * Add the application to your portfolio.


// ## Commit Early and Often

// One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

// * Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

// * Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

// Follow these guidelines for committing:

// * Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

// * Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

// * Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

// * Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

// We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!


// ## Submission on BCS

// You are required to submit the following:

// * The URL of the deployed application

// * The URL of the GitHub repository
